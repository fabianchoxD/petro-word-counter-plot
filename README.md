# petro-word-counter-plot
this is a short excercise to plot the Colombia president Gustavo petro possession speech

## Introduction
In this project I will be using some web scraping tools for python to have a simple sight of the most common words used in the possetion speech from President of México Gustavo Petro found on "cuestión pública" website".

After retrieving our data set using <b>BeautifulSoup</b>, we will use the package <b>word_cloud</b> to convert our obteined text into a wordcloud image in order to focus on the words used on it.<br>

Also we included some repeated and not relevant words to the "exclusion" word list. <br>

## Result
Here is the .png plot image result with 20.000 words:
